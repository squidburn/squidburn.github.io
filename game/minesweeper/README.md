## How to Play

1. The game consists of a grid of squares. Some squares contain mines, while others do not.
2. Click on a square to reveal it. If it contains a mine, you lose the game. If it does not, the square will display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.
3. Use the numbers to deduce where the mines are located and continue clicking on squares to reveal them.
4. The game is won when all non-mine squares are revealed.
